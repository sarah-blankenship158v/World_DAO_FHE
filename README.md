# World DAO FHE: A Player-Governed Autonomous Worlds Platform

World DAO FHE is an innovative platform that empowers player communities to govern their own "autonomous worlds" using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. By leveraging highly secure and privacy-preserving voting mechanisms, players can modify the core parameters of their worlds, including physical rules and economic models, ensuring a truly democratic governance structure.

## The Governance Dilemma

In many gaming ecosystems, decisions about game rules and world parameters often lie in the hands of a few affluent players or developers, leading to governance issues and player dissatisfaction. As games evolve into more intricate ecosystems — especially as we head toward the metaverse — there is a pressing need for a system that allows for equitable participation and decision-making among all players. How can we ensure that every player has an equal voice in shaping their world? 

## Zama's FHE Solution

Our solution lies in the implementation of Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption. By utilizing this advanced technology, we allow players to propose and vote on changes to the world’s governance structure in a secure manner. Votes are encrypted, ensuring that even while calculations are performed, the data remains confidential. This means that every vote is counted without revealing individual player choices until the results are aggregated and disclosed, preventing manipulation by whales or other malicious entities.

World DAO FHE utilizes Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, making the platform not just secure but also reliable and adaptable for future developments.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Proposals & Voting:** Players can propose changes to governance rules and vote securely using FHE encryption.
- **Community Governance:** Directly empowering players to become true stewards of their environment.
- **Protection Against Manipulation:** Ensures that governance is not driven by a few large stakeholders, promoting fairness.
- **Metaverse Integration:** A critical step toward realizing the vision of decentralized metaverses where players have control over their experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The primary component for secure, confidential computing.
- **Node.js:** For server-side scripting.
- **Hardhat:** Development environment for Ethereum.
- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **IPFS:** For decentralized storage.

## Installation Guide

To set up this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js**: Install the latest LTS version.
2. **Hardhat**: Required for development and testing.

Once prerequisites are set up, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files (do NOT clone the repository).
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile and run the project, execute the following commands in the terminal:

1. **Compile contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy to a test network** (ensure you have a configured network in `hardhat.config.js`):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

Here’s an example of how to create a voting mechanism using the Zama FHE SDK:

```javascript
import { FHE } from "zama-fhe-sdk";

// Example function to submit a vote
async function submitVote(vote) {
    const encryptedVote = await FHE.encrypt(vote);
    // Submit encrypted vote to the smart contract
    await contract.submitVote(encryptedVote);
}

// Example usage
const playerVote = { proposalId: "123", choice: "yes" };
submitVote(playerVote);
```
